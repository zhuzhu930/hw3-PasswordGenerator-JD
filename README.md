## 1. My thought process:

In the homework, I need to fix the following:

1. Use "widnow.prompts()" or "window.confirm()" to capture the data from the user.
2. Pass the data into variables in JS.
3. Create arrays for different types of characters.
4. Use the variable values as arguments to create functions.
5. In the function, use the proper arrays to generate random passwords that meet the criteria.

However, after days of researching online and trying to tackle each problem, due to my limited knowledge of JavaScript, I tried several options but was not able to capture the data from "window.prompts()" properly and pass the data into my functions.
Frustrated, I saw some of the snapshots my classmates posted on Slack. Then, I decided to leverage my knowledge of HTML and CSS to make my JS file work.

## 2. I've done the following:

- I modified HTML by adding a form with checkboxes and input labels to capture the user's response. Then I used the more familiar "getElementbyId" and "addEventListener" methods to capture the data. I also changed the button location in the HTML, so while using the "submit" feature of the button, the data I captured from the user can be properly used.

- I used CSS to design my modified HTML, applying grid display in the form section I added to the HTML. I made sure the design is clean and consistent to the original style.

- For character codes, I used the ASCII codes here: https://www.ascii-code.com/.

- for JS, I've done some research on how to create arrays by using ASCII codes, how to generate a random string by using function.

## 3. Review my HTML, CSS and JavaScript files to capture any errors.

- I was not able to figure out the prompts part, but I tried another approach by using the more familiar knowledge I have to build a working App.
- I'll keep trying to see whether I can fix the prompts part.

## 4. Leaving comments.

- While modifying the files, I've used commenting feature to seperate sections, try out different options by hide/unhide my code.
- When I was happy with the result, I then cleaned up my comments by only leaving the necessary ones for the reviewer.

## 5. Write the README.md, to summarize what I've done.

## 6. How I did my research.

- I did my research on w3schools, MDN web docs, StackFlow, GeeksforGeeks.org to understand more about getElementbyID, addEventListener, functions, arrays, ASCII code and use cases, etc.

- I've also watched a couple of Youtube videos on generating passwords.

## In conclusion:

This homework is not easy, as even though we've learned a lot of concepts in class, it was hard to apply them properly in such a short time. I was frustrated for a long time, until my classmate's solution gave me some hope. I understand that I have to figure out a couple of more things for this homework, I'll keep on trying!
